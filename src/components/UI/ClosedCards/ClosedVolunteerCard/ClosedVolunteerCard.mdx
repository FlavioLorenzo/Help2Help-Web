# ClosedVolunteerCard

Card that provides an overview of a volunteer, to be generally shown in the home section of an organization.

## Basic usage

ClosedVolunteerCard uses react-intl for internationalization purposes. For the component to work, it must be wrapped inside an IntlProvider component 
(in the actual implementation the whole app is wrapped with IntlProvider, so usually wrapping is not required).

<Playground>
    <IntlProvider defaultLocale="it">
        <ClosedVolunteerCard fullName="Jane Doe" age="21" imageSrc="https://images.pexels.com/photos/415829/pexels-photo-415829.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-pixabay-415829.jpg&fm=jpg" itemSelected={() => alert("Closed card was clicked.")}></ClosedVolunteerCard>
    </IntlProvider>
</Playground>
