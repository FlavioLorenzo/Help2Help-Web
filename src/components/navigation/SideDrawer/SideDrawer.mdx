Container for the menu to be displayed upon clicking on the navigation menu burger.

## Basic usage

The iframe has been introduced simply because otherwise everything would be crashing badly :)

    <iframe>
        <SideDrawer isMenuOpen={true} />
    </iframe>
</Playground>

## Properties

<Props of={SideDrawer} />
